### Building and Running the Monolith Frontend
The monolith frontend project is a backbone single page web application that was generated by [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). Familiarizing yourself with yeoman will help you better understand how to generate new scaffolding for the mvc architecture of [backbonejs](http://backbonejs.org/).

#### Standards
With great power comes great responsibility. Before you dive into coding make sure are following our conventions. We follow the node.js [javascript conventions](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide).

All new contributions must be submitted by pull request.

#### Environment
We use a standard OSX development configuration. Things like editor and terminal are not enforced. But be sure to be using a robust setup.

We recommend [Iterm2](http://iterm2.com/), [Ultimate Vim](http://vim.spf13.com/), [Silver Seacher](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim)
